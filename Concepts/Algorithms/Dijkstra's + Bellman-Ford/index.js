 - Bellman-Ford's algorithm is more effective than Dijkstra's algorithm because it can accomodate negative weights
    - However, Bellman-Ford algorithm can take a long time to run, with worst case runtime being O(n^2)

    - Dijkstra's algorithm is faster and more efficient than Bellman-Ford's algorithm

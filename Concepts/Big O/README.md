Big O Asymptotic Analysis

- How long an algorithm takes to run
  - Which one is better when it comes to scale?

Run time: How long something takes to run

Tips:

- For any operation that is run within the same indentation, you add the runtimes together. For any operation that happens with identation that is nested, you multiply runtimes together.

**3 Pillars of Programming**

- Readable
- Memory (Space Complexity)
- Speed (Time Complexity)

Sometimes there is usually a tradeoff between Memory and Speed.

Rule 1: Worst Case
Rule 2: Remove Constants
Rule 3: Different Terms for Inputs
Rule 4: Drop Non-Dominants

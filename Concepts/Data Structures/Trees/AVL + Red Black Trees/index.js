/* 
In production, you want to have a balanced search tree - Thus, you'd use a self-balancing tree like an AVL or Red Black Tree
// Usually, you use some type of library that implemenets these trees 

// AVL Trees 
// Faster lookups than Red Black trees
// Slow add/remove

// Red Black Trees
// Faster for add/remove
